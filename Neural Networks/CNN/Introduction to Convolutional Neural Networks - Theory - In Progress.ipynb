    "\n",
    "1. The first layer extracts raw features, like vertical and horizontal edges\n",
    "2. The second layer extracts more abstract features such as textures (using the features extracted by the first layer)\n",
    "3. The subsequent layers may identify certain parts of the image such as skin, hair, nose, mouth etc. based on the textures.\n",
    "4. Layers further up may identify faces, limbs etc. \n",
    "5. Finally, the last layer may classify the image as 'human', 'cat' etc.\n",
